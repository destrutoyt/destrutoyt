## HOW TO REACH ME
I totally understand that a phone number or email would be preferred for a synchronous communication, but sadly, personal info can't be given away on a public profile. However, I am more than happy to connect with you via my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelgarcesl/) :)!
