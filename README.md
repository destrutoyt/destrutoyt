## ABOUT ME
My name is **Miguel Garces Lenis** and I am currently studying towards completing my **B.S. in Software Engineering** at Western Governors University (WGU) with an anticipated graduation date in **July 2027**.
I am currently looking for internships or entry-level opportunities at any company looking for a **software engineer or web developer (Front-end, back-end, or full-stack)**. However, I am open to other roles as well :D!

## PROJECTS

It features many elements, including tables, lists, navigations (including dropdowns), and much more for a website related to the state of New Jersey.
- **Portfolio Website** -> Coming very soon!! This will serve as my portfolio to showcase my projects, learn more about me, and find other ways to contact me. It is being developed in HTML, CSS (Along with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. In addition, it will feature a responsive design for all devices, smooth animations, and a dark/light theme.

## HOW TO REACH ME (This will be updated once Portfolio Web is out!)
I totally understand that a phone number or email would be preferred for synchronous communication, but sadly, personal info can't be given away on a public profile. However, I am more than happy to connect with you via my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelgarcesl/) :)!
